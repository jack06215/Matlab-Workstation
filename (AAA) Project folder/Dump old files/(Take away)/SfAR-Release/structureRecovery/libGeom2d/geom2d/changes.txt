changes in geom2d

* new features

- new functions for polygons:
    polygonPoint, polygonSubcurve, polygonLoops, distancePointPolygon, 
    distancePolygons, expandPolygon, polygonSelfIntersections,
    projPointOnPolygon, isPointInPolygon, reveresPolygon
    
- new functions for polylines:
    intersectPolylines, polylineSelfIntersections, distancePolylines,
    isPointOnPolyline, reveresPolyline

- projPointOnPolyline can also return the distance of the point to the polyline

- function 'edgeToLine' converts an edge to its supporting line

* Changes

- Renamed functions
    + subcurve      -> polylineSubCurve
    + curveCentroid -> polylineCentroid
    + invertLine    -> reverseLine
            
- Compatibility considerations
    + parallelLine: changed convention for signed distance

 * various bug fixes, and doc updates.
